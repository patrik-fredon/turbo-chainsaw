# Spec-ify Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Specification-First Development
Every feature MUST begin with a clear, user-centric specification before any implementation planning. Specifications MUST include prioritized user stories, measurable success criteria, and acceptance scenarios. No code shall be written without an approved specification that defines the problem space and solution boundaries.

### II. Structured Implementation Planning
Implementation MUST follow a phased approach: Setup → Foundational → User Stories → Polish. Each phase MUST have clear completion criteria and validation checkpoints. Foundational infrastructure MUST be complete before any user story implementation begins. User stories MUST be independently testable and deliverable as MVP increments.

### III. Template-Driven Workflow
All development artifacts MUST use the provided templates without deviation. Specifications MUST use spec-template.md, plans MUST use plan-template.md, tasks MUST use tasks-template.md. Templates ensure consistency across all features and enable proper tooling support. Custom formats are prohibited except through formal constitution amendment.

### IV. Independent User Story Delivery
Each user story MUST be independently completable, testable, and valuable. Stories MUST be prioritized (P1, P2, P3) with clear acceptance criteria. Implementation MUST allow any single story to function as a standalone MVP. Cross-story dependencies MUST be minimized and explicitly justified when unavoidable.

## Development Standards

### Technology Stack Flexibility
The constitution is technology-agnostic. Each feature MUST specify appropriate technology choices in the implementation plan. Technology decisions MUST be justified based on feature requirements, team expertise, and long-term maintainability. No technology shall be imposed without feature-specific justification.

### Branch Naming Convention
Feature branches MUST use numbered prefixes: XXX-feature-description (e.g., 001-user-authentication). Numbers MUST be three digits with leading zeros and MUST be unique within the repository. Branch names MUST map to corresponding specification directories in specs/.

### Documentation Completeness
All features MUST maintain complete documentation including specification, implementation plan, task breakdown, and research artifacts. Documentation MUST be updated in real-time as development progresses. Incomplete documentation MUST block feature completion.

## Quality Assurance

### Test-Driven Validation
Testing approach MUST be defined for each feature based on its requirements. Contract tests, integration tests, or unit tests MUST be specified when applicable. Tests MUST validate independent user story functionality. Testing strategy MUST be documented in the implementation plan.

### Cross-Artifact Consistency
All development artifacts (specification, plan, tasks, research) MUST remain consistent throughout development. Changes to one artifact MUST be propagated to related artifacts. Inconsistencies MUST be resolved before feature completion. The /speckit.analyze command MUST be used to validate consistency.

### Quality Gates
Features MUST pass quality gates before completion: all tasks completed, documentation consistent, acceptance criteria met, and quickstart validation successful. Quality gates MUST be enforced through the implementation workflow.

## Governance

### Constitution Supremacy
This constitution supersedes all other development practices and guidelines. All tools, templates, and workflows MUST comply with constitutional principles. Conflicts between this constitution and other documents MUST be resolved in favor of the constitution.

### Amendment Process
Constitutional amendments require: (1) Proposed changes documented with rationale, (2) Review period for team feedback, (3) Formal approval through consensus, (4) Version increment according to semantic versioning, (5) Template synchronization across all dependent artifacts, (6) Communication of changes to all team members.

### Compliance Verification
All pull requests and feature reviews MUST verify constitutional compliance. Automated tools MUST check template usage and branch naming. Manual reviews MUST validate specification quality and independent user story design. Non-compliant features MUST not be merged.

### Runtime Guidance
This constitution provides the authoritative guidance for development operations. CLAUDE.md and other runtime documentation MUST align with constitutional principles. Conflicts MUST be resolved by updating the runtime documentation to match the constitution.
