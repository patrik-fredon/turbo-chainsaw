## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-25
- Q: What should happen when the configuration file has errors? → A: Graceful degradation - menu displays with partial functionality and error messages
- Q: How should users trigger the menu? → A: System-wide hotkey binding (e.g., Super+Space)
- Q: How should icons be handled for different screen densities? → A: Multiple resolution support with automatic scaling (PNG/SVG at various sizes)
- Q: How should configuration changes be handled? → A: Automatic detection with user notification when changes applied
- Q: How should pagination be controlled when there are many buttons? → A: Previous/Next buttons with page indicators (e.g., "Page 1 of 3")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Quick Application Launch (Priority: P1)

As a desktop user, I want to press a hotkey to instantly display a menu of my frequently used applications so that I can launch them quickly without navigating through file systems or application menus.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality that provides immediate user value and solves the primary problem of quick application access.

**Independent Test**: The menu can be displayed and applications launched successfully with only the main menu configuration (no categories required).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the menu is configured with applications, **When** I press the designated hotkey, **Then** the menu appears centered on my screen with all configured buttons visible
2. **Given** the menu is displayed, **When** I click on any application button, **Then** the corresponding application launches immediately and the menu closes
3. **Given** I have more than 10 applications configured, **When** the menu displays, **Then** I see only the first 10 applications with Previous/Next buttons and page indicators to navigate between pages

### User Story 2 - Organized Application Categories (Priority: P2)

As a user with many applications, I want to organize my applications into categories so that I can find specific types of applications quickly and keep my main menu uncluttered.

**Why this priority**: This enhances organization and usability for power users while maintaining simplicity for basic users.

**Independent Test**: Categories can be created and applications assigned to them, with category buttons appearing on the main menu and opening sub-menus when clicked.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have configured categories with assigned applications, **When** the main menu displays, **Then** I see category buttons mixed with regular application buttons
2. **Given** I click on a category button, **When** the sub-menu opens, **Then** I see only the applications assigned to that category with a way to return to the main menu
3. **Given** an application is assigned to a category, **When** I view the main menu, **Then** that application does NOT appear as a separate button on the main menu

### User Story 3 - Visual Customization and Branding (Priority: P3)

As a user, I want to customize the visual appearance of my menu including the main icon, background style, and quote so that it reflects my personal preferences and matches my desktop theme.

**Why this priority**: While not essential for functionality, visual customization enhances user satisfaction and integration with their desktop environment.

**Independent Test**: The menu appearance can be changed through configuration without affecting application launching functionality.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have configured custom icons and styling, **When** the menu displays, **Then** it shows my chosen main icon, glass-like background, and hover effects
2. **Given** I have configured a custom quote, **When** the menu displays, **Then** my chosen quote appears at the bottom of the menu
3. **Given** I hover over any button, **When** the cursor is over the button, **Then** I see visual feedback indicating the button is interactive

### Edge Cases

- **Configuration errors**: Menu displays with error messages and partial functionality when configuration file is malformed or missing
- **Command execution failures**: Display error notification to user and keep menu open for troubleshooting
- **Missing or invalid icons**: Use fallback default icons and continue functioning
- **Screen resolution extremes**: Menu scales appropriately for very low (1024x768) to very high (4K+) resolutions
- **Multiple menu instances**: Prevent duplicate menu instances and focus existing window
