# Tasks: Fredon Menu - Customizable Application Launcher

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-fredon-menu/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are optional - only include them if explicitly requested in the feature specification.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- **Mobile**: `api/src/`, `ios/src/` or `android/src/`
- Paths shown below assume single project - adjust based on plan.md structure

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [x] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan
- [x] T002 Initialize Python project with GTK3 dependencies
- [x] T003 [P] Create packaging configuration files
- [x] T004 [P] Setup development environment files (.gitignore, README.md, etc.)

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] T005 Setup GTK3 application framework with Wayland support
- [x] T006 [P] Implement configuration management system
- [x] T007 [P] Create icon loading and caching system
- [x] T008 Implement secure command execution framework
- [x] T009 Setup error handling and user notification system
- [x] T010 Configure Hyprland integration and hotkey binding

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Quick Application Launch (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Display centered menu with application buttons that launch on click

**Independent Test**: Configure applications in JSON, press hotkey, see menu, click button to launch app, menu closes

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [x] T011 [P] [US1] Create MenuConfig data model in src/menu/models.py
- [x] T012 [P] [US1] Create Button data model in src/menu/models.py

- [x] T021 [US1] Create default configuration file in src/data/default.json
- [x] T022 [US1] Add GTK styling for basic button appearance in src/menu/style.css

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Organized Application Categories (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Organize applications into categories with sub-menus

**Independent Test**: Create categories, assign apps, see category buttons on main menu, click to open sub-menu with back button

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [x] T023 [P] [US2] Create Category data model in src/menu/models.py
- [x] T024 [P] [US2] Implement category filtering logic in src/menu/config.py

- [x] T028 [US2] Update configuration schema for categories in src/data/default.json
- [x] T029 [US2] Add category-specific styling in src/menu/style.css

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Visual Customization and Branding (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Customizable visual appearance with glass effects and theming

**Independent Test**: Change theme settings in config, see updated appearance with glass effects and hover animations

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [x] T034 [P] [US3] Create icon scaling system for different screen densities in src/utils/cache.py
- [x] T035 [US3] Add real-time configuration monitoring in src/menu/config.py
- [x] T036 [US3] Implement user notification system for configuration changes
- [x] T037 [US3] Create default icon set in src/data/icons/
- [x] T038 [US3] Add comprehensive theme options to default configuration

**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional with full visual customization

---

## Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

- [x] T039 [P] Add comprehensive error handling and logging
- [x] T040 [P] Create PKGBUILD for Arch Linux packaging

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Models before services
- Services before endpoints
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create MenuConfig data model in src/menu/models.py"
Task: "Create Button data model in src/menu/models.py"

# Launch UI components in parallel:
Task: "Create GTK window with layer shell in src/menu/window.py"
Task: "Create button widget component in src/menu/button.py"
Task: "Create main application entry point in src/main.py"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Configuration changes detected automatically with user notifications
- Glass-like visual effects implemented through GTK CSS styling
- Pagination uses Previous/Next buttons with page indicators
- System-wide hotkey binding through Hyprland integration
- Multi-resolution icon support with automatic scaling
- Error handling uses graceful degradation with user notifications

---

## Total Task Count: 50

**Tasks by Phase**:
- Phase 1 (Setup): 4 tasks
- Phase 2 (Foundational): 6 tasks
- Phase 3 (US1 - Quick Launch): 12 tasks
- Phase 4 (US2 - Categories): 7 tasks
- Phase 5 (US3 - Visual Customization): 9 tasks
- Phase 6 (Polish): 12 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: 31 tasks marked as parallelizable
