# Implementation Plan: Fredon Menu - Customizable Application Launcher

**Branch**: `001-fredon-menu` | **Date**: 2025-10-25 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-fredon-menu/spec.md`

## Summary

Create a Hyprland/Wayland-compatible application launcher that displays a centered menu with configurable buttons for launching applications. The system will support glass-like visual effects, pagination for large button collections, category-based organization, and customizable theming through a JSON configuration file. Implementation will use Python with GTK3 and gtk-layer-shell for optimal Wayland integration and performance.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+
**Primary Dependencies**: GTK3, gtk-layer-shell, python-gobject, gdk-pixbuf2, python-pillow
**Storage**: JSON configuration file at ~/.config/fredon-menu/config.json, optional icon cache
**Testing**: pytest with GTK test fixtures, integration testing with Hyprland
**Target Platform**: Arch Linux with Hyprland/Wayland compositor
**Project Type**: single desktop application
**Performance Goals**: <500ms menu display, <50MB idle memory, 60fps animations
**Constraints**: Wayland-only, Hyprland blur effects integration, glass-like UI aesthetics
**Scale/Scope**: Single user desktop application supporting 50+ configured applications

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Constitution Compliance Analysis

**✅ I. Specification-First Development**: Complete specification with user stories, acceptance criteria, and measurable success criteria exists.

**✅ II. Structured Implementation Planning**: Plan follows phased approach (Setup → Foundational → User Stories → Polish) with clear validation checkpoints.

**✅ III. Template-Driven Workflow**: All artifacts use provided templates (spec-template.md, plan-template.md, tasks-template.md).

**✅ IV. Independent User Story Delivery**: User stories designed for independent testing and MVP delivery (P1: Quick Launch, P2: Categories, P3: Visual Customization).

### Technology Stack Justification

**Python + GTK3 Selection Rationale**:
- **Constitution Compliance**: Technology-agnostic choice justified by feature requirements
- **Performance**: Sufficient for <500ms display requirement and <50MB memory target
- **Maintainability**: Rapid development, extensive documentation, large community
- **Integration**: Excellent Wayland support through gtk-layer-shell
- **Cross-platform**: Compatible with various Wayland compositors beyond Hyprland

### Development Standards Compliance

**✅ Technology Stack Flexibility**: Choices justified based on performance requirements and Wayland integration needs.

**✅ Documentation Completeness**: Plan includes complete technical context, performance targets, and integration approach.

**✅ Quality Assurance**: Testing strategy defined for GTK application with performance validation.

**Structure Decision**: Single Python package structure with clear separation between UI components, business logic, and utilities. Follows Python packaging standards with proper module organization.

## Complexity Tracking

No constitutional violations requiring justification. All decisions align with established principles and requirements.

### Phase Dependencies

**Phase 1 (Setup)**: No external dependencies beyond standard Python libraries and GTK components.

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**: Depends on successful GTK/gtk-layer-shell integration and configuration parsing.

**User Story Independence**: Each user story can be implemented and tested independently:
- **US1 (P1)**: Basic menu display and app launching
- **US2 (P2)**: Category system and sub-menus
- **US3 (P3)**: Visual styling and customization

### Technical Risk Assessment

**Low Risk**: Python GTK development is well-established with extensive documentation and community support.

**Medium Risk**: Wayland integration complexity mitigated by mature gtk-layer-shell library.

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Progressive development starting with basic functionality
- Comprehensive testing at each phase
- Fallback options for visual effects if Wayland features unavailable

## Updated Requirements Based on Clarifications

### Enhanced Functional Requirements

**Error Handling**:
- Menu displays with partial functionality and error messages when configuration has issues
- Graceful degradation for missing icons and failed command execution
- User notifications for configuration changes and errors

**User Experience**:
- System-wide hotkey binding (Super+Space) for menu activation
- Previous/Next buttons with page indicators for pagination
- Automatic icon scaling for different screen densities
- Real-time configuration monitoring with user notifications

**Performance**:
- Automatic configuration change detection and application
- Multi-resolution icon support with caching
- Responsive pagination controls

## Next Steps

1. **Phase 0 Complete**: Research resolves all technical unknowns
2. **Phase 1 Complete**: Data models, contracts, and quickstart documentation created
3. **Phase 2 Ready**: Proceed to task breakdown and implementation planning

All constitutional requirements satisfied. All clarifications integrated. Ready to proceed with `/speckit.tasks` for implementation planning.
